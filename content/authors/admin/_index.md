Iâ€™m Alison, and I currently serve as a consultant and internal business intelligence for a fully remote firm that supports fundraising at mission-driven organizations. My experience has included data analysis projects for clients; designing, building, and managing small internal databases and applications; leading a CRM upgrade and conversion; implementing BI dashboards; and ongoing management of CRM and IT services for a medium-sized professional services firm. 

An example of my data analysis (outside of work):
