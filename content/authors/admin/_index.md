Iâ€™m Alison, and I am a data strategist and analyst for mission-driven organizations. I'm an optimizer and system-builder by nature, solving organizational problems with data tools and products. My experience includes data analysis projects for various nonprofit organizations across the sector; designing, building, and managing small internal databases and applications; leading a CRM upgrade and implementation of new business systems; building BI dashboards; and management of CRM and IT services for a medium-sized professional services firm.
