I’m Alison, and I currently serve as a consultant and internal business intelligence for a firm that supports fundraising at mission-driven organizations. My experience has included data analysis projects for clients; designing, building, and managing small internal databases and applications; and managing IT services for a medium-sized professional services firm. As I look forward, I’m eager to invest further in my statistical skills working on projects that advance progressive causes. 

An example my data analysis (outside of work):

If you don't have my contact info, the best way to get in touch with me is through Twitter.
